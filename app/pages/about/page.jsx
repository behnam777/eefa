        <h1 className="about-title">Our Story</h1>
        <p className="about-stoy">EEFA ARCHITECTS is a newly established architecture firm that focuses on delivering
            creative and innovative
            designs, tailored to the specific needs of each project. The company works across various fields, including
            residential, villa, office, and landscape projects, and has already gained recognition for satisfying its
            clients in a short period of time.

            Unveiling the "Event"
            The core philosophy of EEFA ARCHITECTS is that each project has its own unique features and potential. The
            role
            of the architect is to discover these distinct elements and present them in the most beautiful and
            functional
            way. Each project tells its own story, and at EEFA, we strive to reveal that story through a design that
            emerges
            naturally from the site and its context.

            - Amir, born in 1992, holds a Masterâ€™s degree in Architecture and is always on the lookout for new
            challenges
            to test his skills. For Amir, architecture is like a game with its own set of rules, and these rules change
            with every project, making each one unique. He strives to understand the specific constraints and conditions
            of each project and deliver his best "play" in line with them, bringing creativity and functionality
            together in his designs.
